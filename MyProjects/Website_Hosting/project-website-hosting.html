                <h2>The Vision: A Showcase of Practical Experience</h2>
                <p>My goal was to create more than just a static resume. I needed a way to bridge the gap between my skills and the common requirement of 2-3 years of professional experience seen in most job postings. It's the classic dilemma: how do you get experience if no one will hire you without it? This portfolio is my answer.</p>
                <p>I decided to showcase my personal projects in this detailed manner to provide tangible proof of my abilities. It's a living document designed to demonstrate not just what I know, but how I solve problems, learn new technologies, and manage a project from start to finish.</p>

                <h2>The Technical Foundation</h2>
                <p>The first phase was planning the technical infrastructure. Having previously used a self-hosted <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> server on a Linux machine, I understood the fundamentals but needed a more reliable solution for a public-facing site. Our planning led to a hybrid workflow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Testing:</strong> Using my own home server for a private, real-world testing environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Live Deployment:</strong> Choosing modern static site hosting for its speed, security, and reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Domain Configuration:</strong> Selecting my universally compatible `.pw` domain and learning to point its DNS records to the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">live host</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h2>A Unique Collaborative Process</h2>
                <p>The structure and content of this site were developed through a unique, iterative collaboration. I worked with the AI assistant, <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Gemini</a>  , to brainstorm ideas, generate code, and—most importantly—refine my personal stories into the professional case studies you see on this site.</p>
                <p>Our workflow was simple yet effective: I provided the detailed, personal narrative for each project, and the AI helped me structure it into clean HTML, suggesting sections and highlighting key skills. This process even included real-world troubleshooting, like diagnosing and fixing the relative file path issues that arose when I organized the projects into subfolders—a practical lesson in web development.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Writing semantic HTML5 and responsive CSS3 from the ground up.</li>
                    <li>**Deployment & Hosting:** Implementing a hybrid local/live hosting workflow and configuring DNS.</li>
                    <li>**Project Management:** Iterating on a project from concept to deployment, organizing content, and managing files.</li>
                    <li>**Technical Troubleshooting:** Diagnosing and fixing file path and navigation issues.</li>
                    <li>**AI Collaboration:** Effectively using AI as a tool for brainstorming, code generation, and content structuring.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This portfolio encapsulates the very skills it was built to showcase: problem-solving, resourcefulness, and a passion for building things. I hope these projects serve their purpose of demonstrating my hands-on experience and technical capabilities in place of a traditional work history.</p>
                <p>This entire process has reinforced my ability to take a concept, navigate the challenges, and deliver a polished final product. I am very excited to keep learning and start applying my skills in a professional workplace.</p>
