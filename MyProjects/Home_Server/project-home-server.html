                <h2>The Goal: Escaping Cloud Subscriptions</h2>
                <p>I wanted to save money on cloud subscriptions for my family by creating our own local file storage. My first attempt was a simple Windows shared folder, which worked for basic file sharing but also sparked my curiosity: how do sophisticated cloud services really work? The service my family uses most is <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/photos/about/">Google Photos</a>, so I set a new goal: find a self-hosted alternative that offered a similar experience.</p>

                <h2>The Discovery: An App Store for Servers</h2>
                <p>After diving into research and trying a few options that didn't quite work the way I envisioned, my search led me to a game-changer: <a href="https://casaos.zimaspace.com/">**CasaOS**</a>. It's an open-source home server system that works like an app store for server applications, dramatically simplifying the installation process. Inside its "store," I found the perfect program I had been looking for: <a href="https://immich.app/">**Immich**</a>.</p>
                <p>It’s a near-perfect clone of Google Photos, complete with powerful organization and face-recognition search. I could create private accounts for my family members and manage their storage space, with everything hosted securely on my own machine. CasaOS also made it easy to install other useful services, like a central file-sharing hub and a network-wide adblocker.</p>

                <h2>The Breakthrough: Merging Two Projects into One</h2>
                <p>I was thrilled with this setup, but then I had a discovery that took it to the next level. I realized I could merge this new home server with the DIY gaming console I had already built. While exploring the Batocera Unofficial Addons for my gaming machine, I saw that **CasaOS could be installed directly onto Batocera**. It was a huge "aha!" moment!</p>
                <p>I was incredibly excited—this meant I could centralize everything onto a single computer, saving space, electricity, and money. It was the key to ultimate efficiency.</p>

                <h2>The Final Product: A Unified Powerhouse</h2>
                <p>Now, I have just one computer running 24/7. It's an always-on gaming console, ready to go the moment I turn on the TV. I can even stream games from it to any device, and all the while, it’s silently running in the background as our family's private home server for photos, files, and adblocking. It's the ultimate all-in-one machine, seamlessly serving two completely different purposes.</p>

                <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>**System Consolidation & Efficiency:** Merging two distinct systems (gaming and server) onto a single machine to save resources.</li>
                    <li>**Server Administration:** Deploying and managing applications like Immich and file shares using CasaOS.</li>
                    <li>**Linux & Open-Source Software Integration:** Configuring CasaOS to run concurrently with the Batocera OS.</li>
                    <li>**Network Services Configuration:** Implementing a network-wide adblocker and secure family accounts for photo sharing.</li>
                    <li>**Resourcefulness & Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Identifying a DIY path to replace paid cloud subscriptions and consolidating hardware for long-term savings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This project evolved from a simple desire to save money into a deep exploration of system efficiency. By combining my gaming and server projects, I created a single, powerful, and cost-effective machine that meets my entire family's needs for both entertainment and secure data management. It stands as a testament to the power and flexibility of open-source software.</p>
