                <h2>The Spark: Gaming on a Legacy Machine</h2>
                <p>My fascination with computers and technology ignited around 2017. It began with an old 2009 HP desktop my mom brought home. Eager to game, I started with simpler 2D titles, rhythm games, and early MMOs. However, watching YouTube videos of incredible AAA games quickly revealed the HP's limitations. It just couldn't keep up.</p>
                <p>This sparked a deep dive into research. I was determined to make those demanding games run. I learned to meticulously adjust in-game settings, ensure drivers were updated, and optimize the entire system. When that wasn't enough, I even discovered how to edit game files to push graphics settings lower than the game allowed. While the visuals suffered, the satisfaction of playing was immense. This early experience taught me the profound impact of optimization and the value of pushing hardware to its limits.</p>

                <h2>The Genesis: Building My First PC</h2>
                <p>A few years later, at 18, my first job allowed me to save for a powerful PC capable of running the latest AAA games. With pandemic-inflated prices, building my own seemed the most logical and cost-effective path. My prior research into game optimization had already familiarized me with many components, giving me a head start.</p>
                <p>I dove into extensive research on component compatibility, identifying bottlenecks, and balancing performance with my budget. My initial blueprint came from a <a href="https://youtu.be/yq3olnOsfIk">Spanish YouTube guide</a> (my native language), but my first lesson in PC building came immediately: the recommended motherboard was unavailable. This forced me to improvise, researching and selecting a suitable alternative on my own—a crucial exercise in adaptability.</p>

                <h2>The Evolution: Unplanned Upgrades & Deeper Learning</h2>
                <p>After assembling the initial build and testing it for a couple of weeks, it became clear that a major graphics boost was essential for proper gaming performance. I saved up and proudly purchased an **AMD RX 6700 XT**.</p>
                <p>This powerful upgrade led to a cascade of unexpected, yet invaluable, learning experiences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lesson 1: Size Matters.</strong> The new GPU was physically too large for my current case. This necessitated my first unplanned upgrade: a bigger, more accommodating PC case.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lesson 2: Power Demands.</strong> The RX 6700 XT was a thirsty card, quickly revealing my original power supply unit (PSU) was inadequate. This led to a second unplanned upgrade: a more powerful PSU to ensure system stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lesson 3: Aesthetics & Compatibility.</strong> My new case came with vibrant RGB lighting, but my existing motherboard lacked the necessary headers to control it. Committed to the aesthetic, I researched and acquired a new motherboard with the right RGB capabilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The final upgrade involved boosting the **RAM to 32GB**, culminating in what I now consider my first truly custom PC. This iterative, chaotic journey, constantly adapting from the initial video guide and upgrading part-by-part, was the best possible way to learn. It forced a deep understanding of each component's purpose and how they interact, a knowledge I wouldn't have gained from a single, perfect build. As a bonus, all the leftover parts provided a solid foundation for a future project!</p>
