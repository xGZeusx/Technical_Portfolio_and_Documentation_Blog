                <h2>The Inspiration: Recreating a Learning Tool</h2>
                <p>Piano has been my hobby since middle school, where I first started learning from YouTube videos. Recently, I decided to get more serious about my playing, so I enrolled in a few courses and started recording myself to track my progress. That’s when I remembered the mesmerizing Synthesia-style videos I used to learn with—where the keys light up as they're played. I knew I had to replicate that effect on my own piano.</p>

                <p>I searched online for a ready-made kit and found one, but the nearly <a href="https://www.pianoledshop.com/products/piano-led-plus-2026">**$200 price tag**</a> was a bit shocking. That’s what pushed me to research a DIY solution. I discovered I could build my own system for around **$70** using a Raspberry Pi, turning a simple desire into a full-fledged technical project.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Build: New Tools and New Skills</h2>
                <p>I bought all the necessary materials online, following a guide I found on <a href="https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer?tab=readme-ov-file">GitHub</a>. The project required some tools I didn't own and had never used before, but I was committed to learning.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learning to Solder:</strong> The project required a soldering iron to connect the LED strip. I dove in headfirst and, after a few questionable attempts, I learned how to create clean, strong solder joints without burning the house down! It was an invaluable hands-on skill to acquire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headless Configuration via SSH:</strong> While experimenting, I had a cool breakthrough. I learned I could **SSH** into the Raspberry Pi remotely from my main computer. This allowed me to configure everything—the network, the Python scripts, the web server—without ever needing a dedicated monitor or keyboard for the Pi.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Final Product: An Interactive Music Experience</h2>
                <p>The finished project is a sleek LED strip taped neatly above the piano keys, wired directly to a discreet Raspberry Pi Zero. The entire system is controlled by a **custom web UI** that I can access from my tablet, which sits perfectly on the music stand. </p>

    </a>
</div>
                <p>The visualizer has two main functions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Live Mode:</strong> Each key I press on the piano lights up the corresponding LED instantly, providing real-time visual feedback for my practice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playback Mode:</strong> I can send pre-recorded MIDI files through the web UI, and the piano will play the song for me, lights and all—just like those Synthesia videos that inspired the whole project.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Hardware Integration:** Interfacing a Raspberry Pi with an LED strip and a MIDI keyboard.</li>
                    <li>**Basic Soldering & Electronics:** Assembling and connecting electronic components safely and effectively.</li>
                    <li>**Headless System Configuration:** Setting up and managing a device remotely using SSH.</li>
                    <li>**Software & Scripting:** Using Python to process MIDI data and control hardware.</li>
                    <li>**Web Interface Development:** Creating a simple web UI to control a physical device.</li>
                    <li>**Resourcefulness & Problem Solving:** Choosing a cost-effective DIY solution over a commercial product and self-teaching the necessary skills.</li>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This project was the perfect marriage of my passion for music and my interest in technology. It took me from a simple idea to a fully functional, custom-built device that I use regularly. More importantly, it pushed me to learn new, practical skills like soldering and remote system administration, which have significantly boosted my confidence and capabilities.</p>
