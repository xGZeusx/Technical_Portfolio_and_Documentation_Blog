            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As a certified IT Support professional currently advancing my skills through online coursework, I thrive on the challenge of a complex problem. My passion lies in the systematic process of diagnosing an issue, implementing a robust solution, and ensuring optimal system performance. I believe in continuous learning to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my professional work, my interests in music and video games give me a unique, user-focused perspective. I understand the critical importance of a stable, high-performance system, whether it's for a creative workflow or a seamless user experience.
